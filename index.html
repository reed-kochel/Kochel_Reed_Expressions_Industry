Hello! Welcome to my Pixle count calculator. I created a script to determin how many pixles are in a given screen size. This forumla requires the pathagern theory to be applied

However, I didn't make the script just for myself. If you would like to see how many pixles are in your TV, you can use this script and math as well.
Follow the onscreen prompts, and open the browser console to view the answer. Enjoy!
